          <h3>Sephora Project</h3>
          <p>This was a collaboration project with Samantha Padilla. With this project, we decided to make a whimiscal,
            sarcastic site using only HTML. The project was to shed light on the events around 2020 when little kids
            would
            go to Sephora to get makeup supplies. This led to a lot of the workers having to clean up ruined samples and
            giving out chemical cleansers that would be dangerous for children's skin. This project is a showcase of the
            basic HTML elements that my partner and I worked on.</p>

          <h3>Mom, Dad, I'm...</h3>
          <p>Mom, Dad, I’m… is a net art piece reflecting the thoughts that I once had during my time before I came out
            as gay. It is a piece that speaks deep to my core, as I feel as if these were the types of questioning
            thoughts any person trying to tell a deep secret about themselves would think. The thoughts that would swirl
            through my head were many, some ranging from hopeful, happy ‘what if’ thoughts, to much darker, hateful
            thoughts. The navigation through the site is supposed to reflect those thoughts that stick with you.
            Although you are focused on the new prompt that shows up, those past thoughts never go away, still able to
            be perceived and look back on. At the end of the piece, there is no other option but to choose “I want to be
            loved”. This was really what I felt at the end of the day, and the reason for all the hesitation and fear
            about telling my parents. “If I came out, what if they don’t love me the same?” I believe that all humans
            strive for at least some kind of connection, and the thought that the connection could be severed just for
            living a certain way is depressing. I want this piece to be there on the net for people to take a look
            inside my perspective and my own thought processes. And at the end of the page, the page illuminates,
            touching on the lightbulb motif seen the whole time the user interacts with the page. This last prompt was
            the ‘aha’ moment in the piece, seeing myself realize why I was wondering and hesitating the whole time. The
            lightbulb disappears as the light floods the page, but the prompts are still dark, showing that the
            headspace I was in never really went away or erased itself.</p>

          <h3>Ollie</h3>
          <p>This project was really fun to do! It was a passion project, so I did not make this for any class, but this
            puppet is one of my proudest works. I came to create 'Ollie' as I reminisced about the shows I had growing
            up, such as Sesame Street and The Muppet Show, as well as the more mature Avenue Q musical production. With
            those shows in mind, my nostalgia led me to create this puppet over the course of a month. It was a great
            way for me to strengthen both my hand sewing and machine sewing skills! Ollie is a type of self insert if I
            was a puppet in those children shows, and I would say that this piece showcased a bunch of textile and craft
            skills I didn't know I had.</p>

          <h3>Drawing Grid</h3>
          <p> This was a project that I did for my ART 101 class. For my project, I was really inspired by farming games
            and the way that, in those games, players can design their farm layouts and crops. I think that with that
            direction, I was able to create a cohesive theme for this project that many users can interact with,
            creating their own farm layouts using the assets I drew. The creativity comes from viewers figuring out how
            to use these objects and assets to create fun and colorful patterns, almost akin to a zen garden. <br>
            This work is a grid based stamping system, where you control the farmer and move him around the dirt plot.
            You use the arrow keys to plant different types of assets on the board around the farmer, navigating the
            area.
            I think the most successful part of the project was implementing the assets and coding to move the player
            around. I feel as if the way I made the player dissapear as he moves was successful.
            However, due to the way I went about moving the character, much of the difficulty was that whenever the
            character would walk over a crop, it would erase whatever was drawn on that grid. I tried putting meaning
            into why it did that in the instructions, but I really wished I could only remove the farmer png and keep
            the crops on the board as he moved around. <br></p>

          <h3>Call Me</h3>
          <p>Usually in my works I use more of a digital medium, or craft with clay or yarn. This work is a bit
            different, as this was also a project I am making for one of my classes. It was a challenge to work with a
            2x4 wood and craft it into something that looks different from that log. For this project titled “Call
            Me”,
            I really wanted to delve into the nostalgia of the past. I think that there is something really
            melancholic
            about nostalgia, how we always romanticize how the past was in our memories and how we sometimes wish for
            things to go back to the way they were. <br>
            “Call Me” is a wooden statue of a rotary phone, very simple in nature but brings back memories of the past
            aesthetics. It was made using a 4 foot 2x4 cut with a compound mitre saw, band saw, sanded down and
            drilled.
            The piece was attached together using wood glue. Looking at the design of a rotary phone, it is really
            interesting why it was shaped the way they were, to have the phone sit on top of the device, and
            especially
            the rotary mechanics. My barebones depiction of it is supposed to replicate the shape and feel of a rotary
            phone, although much shorter and wider. I added a heart to the back to make it feel a lot more cute, to
            also
            symbolize the romanticisation of the past and to sort of correlate with today’s generation sort of
            reviving
            the past aesthetic and incorporating them into their own style. <br>
            The simplicity and nature of an ordinary object meant to be used also drives people to interact with the
            piece. It sparks this call for play and childish nature everyone has deep inside of them, putting them in
            the mental space of a kid in the “good old days”. I hope some view my piece and feel the same nostalgia
            that
            I feel when making this. “Call Me” is meant to be interacted with, eventually wanting people to interact
            and
            draw on the wood eventually, to symbolize the attachment and identity people have to technology. A phone
            is
            a phone both in the past and now, and we have grown to sort of become our phone.
